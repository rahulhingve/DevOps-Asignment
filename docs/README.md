## Project Overview

For this assignment, I implemented a simple Node.js web application and deployed it to a Digital Ocean droplet using a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The application is a basic Express.js server that returns a welcome message.

While the application itself is simple, I've implemented comprehensive DevOps practices including:

- Automated deployment with GitHub Actions
- Secure SSH-based deployment
- Monitoring with PM2
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Security measures aligned with ISO 27001 and SOC 2

## Screenshots

I've included screenshots in the `screenshots` folder showing:
- The running application
- The Digital Ocean dashboard
- PM2 monitoring
- GitHub Actions workflow runs

## Final Thoughts

This project was a great learning experience! If I had more time, I would have added:
- More extensive testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- Better monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- A more complex application with a database
- Load testing and performance optimization

Thanks for reviewing my submission! Let me know if you have any questions or need more details about any part of it.
